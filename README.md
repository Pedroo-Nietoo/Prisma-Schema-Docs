## Overview

`prisma-schema-docs` is a simple command-line tool that generates HTML documentation for your Prisma schema files. This package reads your `schema.prisma` file and produces an easy-to-read documentation format for your models and their fields, including attributes like `@id`, `@unique`, `@default`, and `@relation`.
